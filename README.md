# Horison Marketing Website Optimization Project

## Description
The objective of this project is to optimize the current Horizon marketing website so that it complies with current accessibility standards. The standards include the use of properly structured semantic HTML elements, which follow a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning. Image elements should use appropriate accessible alt attributes. Heading attributes should follow a sequential order and the title element should have a concise and descriptive title. During the execution of this project, HTML and CSS were utilized.
